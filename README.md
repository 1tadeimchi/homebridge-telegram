## Why a Telegram Bot?

This plugin enables you to send Telegram messages upon certain HomeKit events. The plugin provides
a toggle switch for groups of notifications, which will send out one of the predefined notifications via Telegram to a configured chat. For example, you
could set up a rule to send out a message via Telegram when a window is opened. And with [homebridge-automation-switches](https://github.com/grover/homebridge-automation-switches) you could even repeat that process until the window is closed.

You can also add a little fun to it, by providing many different messages in a group, which the plugin selects
randomly.

The bots are non-interactive, e.g. they do not provide commands to trigger things and will
not listen for messages sent to them.

## Changelog

All changes to homebridge-telegram are documented in the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md).

## Installation instructions

After [Homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge) has been installed:

 ```sudo npm install -g homebridge-telegram```

## Example config.json:

 ```
{
  "bridge": {
      ...
  },
  "platforms": [
    {
      "platform": "Telegram",
      "bots": [
        {
          "name": "Bot name as seen in HomeKit",
          "token": "TELEGRAM BOT TOKEN",
          "chat": "TELEGRAM CHAT ID",
          "error": "Something broken. I'm shutting down.",
          "notifications": {
            "Hello": [
              "mode": "Markdown",
              "randomize": true,
              "messages": [
                "*Hi!*",
                "_Hello!_",
                "Hey mate!"
              ]
            ],
            "Bye": [
              "mode": "HTML",
              "randomize": false,
              "messages": [
                "<b>Good bye!</b>",
                "<i>I'm sad to see you leave.</i>"
              ]
            ],
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

> Simple style configuration will still work and can be mixed with the advanced configuration modes:
>
> ```json
> "Hello": [
>   "Hi!",
>   "Hello!",
>   "Hey mate!"
> ]
> ```

The platform can provide any number of bots that have to be predefined in the homebridge config.json. Each bot supports the following attributes:

| Attributes | Usage |
|------------|-------|
| name | A unique name for the bot. Will be used as the accessory name. |
| token | The Telegram Bot API token provided when you registered the bot. |
| chat | The chat ID used to send the notification to. |
| error | The message to send if something fails. If you do not want an error message visible in Telegram, keep this undefined. |
| notifications | An object providing notifications in named groups. |

A switch is created for each notification group.

### Configuring notification groups

Notification groups have additional configuration options if the new style configuration is used:

| Attributes | Usage |
|------------|-------|
| mode | Specify the format of the notifications. Do not specify this for plain text notifications. Use *Markdown* for markdown notifications and *HTML* for HTML notifications. |
| randomize | If true, will select a message randomly. The default value is true. If you do not want random messages, select false. |
| messages | An array of messages to use for the button. |


## Creating a bot

The folks at Telegram created better [documentation](https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather), than I could ever do.

Once you've created the bot you'll need to find a chat ID that this plugin should send messages to. The easiest
way is to message the bot and look for the JSON dumps in the homebridge log. This also supports group chats.

## Formatting Options

Please read [the formatting options](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#formatting-options) in the Telegram Bot API for
the supported HTML and Markdown formatting options.

## Accessory Services

Each bot will expose two services:

* Accessory Information Service
* Bot Service

## BotService Characteristics

The exposed switch service supports the following characteristics:

| Characteristic | UUID | Permissions | Type | Usage |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Quiet | `9799244D-7E74-471F-B672-C41C262F7337` | READ, WRITE | BOOL | Stops the bot from sending messages, while this is enabled. |

See [HomeKitTypes.js](src/HomeKitTypes.js) for details.

## Supported clients

This platform and the bots it drives have been verified to work with the following apps on iOS 11

* Elgato Eve
